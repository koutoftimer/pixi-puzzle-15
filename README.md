## Experimenting with pixi-js

This is my pet project in which I'm understand what is `pixi-js` for game developing. No strict goals, just implementation of some random game.

## Usage

Fetch required dependencies with `npm` and lauch with your favorit web server, e.g.

```sh
$ # clone repo and cd into it
$ npm install
$ # you can use any web server I prefer to use low amout of tecnologie
$ http-server 
```
